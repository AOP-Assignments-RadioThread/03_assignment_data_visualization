## Architecture

- MVVM pattern
- Separated concerns:
  - `Models`: data structures (e.g., `FoodWasteData`)
  - `ViewModels`: command and UI logic
  - `Services`: CSV parsing and LINQ analysis (`CsvHandler`, `DataAnalyzer`)
  - `Views`: Avalonia XAML-based UI

## Notes

- Charts are responsive and styled for clarity

- Undo/redo stacks are deep-copy safe to prevent UI/control reuse issues
